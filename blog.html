  <h5>1.What is Memory Foam?</h5>
  <p>“Memory foam is made from polyurethane. This is a type of plastic you’ll find in a variety of products, such as sofas, mattresses, insulation, and spray foam. It gets its name from the fact that it can change shape under pressure, but return to its original shape when the pressure is gone. This lets it adjust to your individual shape and gives you extra head and neck support.The support that a  Memory foam pillow gives you helps you sleep in the best position for your spine, one that supports the natural curve of your cervical spine. This is made up of the first seven bones that make up your neck. Memory foam pillows come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from the traditional puffy rectangles to a curved orthopedic model designed for back and side sleepers.”</p>

  <h5>2. Pillow according to the type of sleeper </h5>
  <p>“Back Sleeper -  If you sleep soundly on your back, look for a pillow that nestles the head at an intermediate height. The height adds comfort for sleepers who like to rest their shoulders on the pillow.”</p>
  <p>“Side Sleeper -  Side sleeping in a fetal position opens up the spine and relaxes the muscles. Side sleepers should choose a firmer, contoured pillow with a wave shape to cradle the head. These help to maintain the natural distance between your shoulder and head to keep your posture better aligned.” </p>
  <p>“Stomach Sleeper - It causes the natural curvature in the neck and lower back to flatten, putting excessive stress on your neck. Choose a compressible pillow, which squeezes down into a flatter shape and reduces stress on the neck.”</p>
  <p>“Every Which Way - For those who flop around at night — from back to side to stomach — a  latex pillow might be best. A natural latex pillow is fully customizable — just add or remove as much fill as you need until it feels right for your sleeping patterns.”</p>
  <h5>3. General tips to improve sleep include</h5>
  <p>●	waking up and going to sleep at the same time every day, including at weekends.
<br>●	having a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as having a warm bath or reading a book.
<br>●	avoiding napping during the day.
<br>●	exercising daily.
<br>●	making sure that the bedroom is cool, quiet, and dark.
<br>●	using a comfortable mattress and pillow.
<br>●	avoiding cigarettes and alcohol.
<br>●	avoiding heavy meals before bedtime.

<h5>4. Sleeping without pillow </h5>
<p>Poor posture during the night interferes with a person’s quality of sleep and can lead to aches and pains during the day. The individual might also experience neck or back pain when they wake up. Pillows are important because they keep the head aligned with the neck and backbone during sleep. If a person’s spine or neck is not in a neutral position, they may wake up during the night, causing sleep loss. Sleeping without a pillow may help some people who sleep on their front. It can help keep the spine and the neck in alignment during sleep, easing neck and back pain.
It is not a good idea for everyone, though. People who sleep on their back or side might find that sleeping without a pillow causes neck or back pain.
